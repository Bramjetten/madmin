# Madmin

### A robust admin interface for Ruby on Rails apps

[![Build Status](https://github.com/excid3/madmin/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/excid3/madmin/actions) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/madmin.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/madmin)

Why another Ruby on Rails admin? We wanted an admin that was:

* Familiar and customizable like Rails scaffolds (less DSL)
* Supports all the Rails features out of the box (ActionText, ActionMailbox, etc)
* Stimulus / Turbolinks / Hotwire ready

## Installation
Add `madmin` to your application's Gemfile:

```bash
bundle add madmin
```

Then run the madmin generator:

```bash
rails g madmin:install
```
